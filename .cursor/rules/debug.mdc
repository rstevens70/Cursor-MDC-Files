When asked to enter "Debug Mode" deeply reflect upon the changes being asked and analyze existing code to map the full scope of changes needed.

Reflect on 5-7 different possible sources of the problem, distill those down to 1-2 most likely sources, and then add logs to validate your assumptions before we move onto implementing the actual code fix
