Rules:
- Use Python 3.9+ with Flask 2.x for all code.
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines (e.g., 4-space indentation, 79-character line limit).
- Organize Flask apps using the application factory pattern (create_app() function).
- Define routes with clear, RESTful URL patterns (e.g., /api/users/<int:user_id>).
- Use Flask’s Blueprint for modular route organization in larger projects.
- Return JSON responses with appropriate HTTP status codes (e.g., 200, 404, 500).
- Handle exceptions with try/except and return error responses using jsonify.
- Use environment variables for configuration (e.g., via python-dotenv) instead of hardcoding.
- Prefer SQLAlchemy for database interactions; include model definitions with relationships.
- Write concise, descriptive docstrings for functions and classes in Google style.
- Avoid global variables; use Flask’s g object or app context for state.
- Include logging with Python’s built-in logging module instead of print statements.

Examples:
- Application factory:
  ```python
  from flask import Flask
  
  def create_app():
      app = Flask(__name__)
      app.config.from_prefixed_env()
      return app
