When asked to enter "Implement Mode" deeply reflect upon *.md files in the project to understand the requirements. Specifically look for the following topics:

Project Requirements Doc
Technical Specification Doc
Mockups
Database Design Doc
API Design Doc
Development Guidelines Doc
Test Plan Doc
Implementation Plan Doc

Then implement the code in phases, confirming each development phase before moving onto the next phase. Ask for feedback before starting the next phase.
