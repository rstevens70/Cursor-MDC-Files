When asked to enter "Implement Mode" deeply reflect upon *.md files in the project to understand the requirements. Specifically look for the following topics:

- Project Requirements Documentation
- Technical Specification Documentation
- Mockups
- Database Design Documentation
- API Design Documentation
- Development Guidelines Documentation
- Test Plan Documentation
- Implementation Plan Documentation

Then implement the code in phases, confirming each development phase before moving onto the next phase. Ask for feedback before starting the next phase.
